# AIND - Class exercises and labs
The repository contains my codes made in the AIND ([Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/ai)) classes.

## Term 1 
For the first term I developed two programs:
- _Isolation_: 
Isolation is a game in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner. The program implements Mini-Max algorithm to return the best movement for a player. 

- _Puzzle_: 
A program to solve sudoku using constraint propagation.

And two labs: 
- _Pacman search project_:
In this lab I implemented Breadth-first search, Depth-First search, Uniform-cost search and A star search in the world of Pac-Man helping him find food and other objects in his world in an efficient way. You can check the instructions [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa10/projects/search/search.html). 

- _Simulated annealing_:
In this lab I implemented the simulated annealing algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals.
