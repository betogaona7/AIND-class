# AIND - Class exercises and labs
The repository contains my codes made in the AIND ([Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/ai)) classes.

## Term 1 
For the first term I developed two programs:
- _Isolation_: 
Isolation is a game in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner. The program implements Mini-Max algorithm to return the best movement for a player. 

- _Puzzle_: 
A program to solve sudoku using constraint propagation.

And two labs: 
- _Pacman search project_:
In this lab I implemented Breadth-first search, Depth-First search, Uniform-cost search and A star search in the world of Pac-Man helping him find food and other objects in his world in an efficient way. You can check the instructions [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa10/projects/search/search.html). 

- _Simulated annealing_:
In this lab I implemented the simulated annealing algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals. 

## Term 2
In the second term, I completed several exercises like: 

- _Perceptron_,  _logistic_regression.py_, and  _xor_network.py_: 
As the name implies, the first one is the perceptron algorithm, the second is the logistic regression algorithm, and the last one is an XOR multi-layer perceptron. 
- _dl_concepts.py_: 
This program only contains two functions seen in class, softmax and cross entropy. 

Then I did different exercises according to each specialization:
### Computer Vision
- _Computer-Vision_:
This directory contains three subdirectories corresponding to the first three stages of a general CV pipeline: Preprocessing, Image-segmentation and Features-recognition, each one has several programs related to its name. 

- _CNN-cifar10_:
It is a CNN model that uses data augmentation, and it is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras.

- _MLP_mnist_: 
This is a Multi-layer perceptron to decode images of handwritten numerical digits.

### Natural Language Processing

- _AIND-NLP-Bookworm_
This is a simple question-answering system built using IBM Watson's NLP services.

- _Natural-Language-Processing_
The directory contains two subdirectories which are part of a general NLP pipeline: Text-processing and Modeling. 

### Voice User Interfaces

- _AIND-VUI-ALEXA_:
This is an Alexa skill which provides year-dates facts from AI history.

- _Voice-User-Interfaces_:
This directory contains programs related to automatic speech recognition. Specifically: feature extraction and language model (N-grams) to strengthen out language ambiguities.
